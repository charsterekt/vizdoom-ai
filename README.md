# Reinforcement Learning with VizDoom, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, and Stable Baselines 3

Making use of the above mentioned libraries, I've attempted to train an RL agent to play some levels from the '93 classic, DOOM. The basic level is fairly easy for the agent, there are only 3 actions available and the end goal is to kill a singular passive demon. The defense center level steps things up by adding a wave-defense mechanic. It proves to be more challenging for the agent. Note that death is inevitable in this level as Doomguy runs out of ammo. The final level is deadly corridor, where the agent must make it to the end of the corridor and pick up an armour vest, while overcoming multiple foes. This is the most challenging level, and I approached it using curriculum learning, by gradually increasing the difficulty during training. Due to the amount of time needed for training and dubious early numbers in the Tensorboard logs, I cut the training off short, however the procedure is included in the file should anyone wish to train an agent. I have also included Tensorboard log files for the basic and defense center levels.
